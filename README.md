We can fake it using the below example simulates the steps

``` shell,script(name="full")
{
    sleep 1
    echo -ne "fix\r"
    sleep 1
    echo -ne "github\r"
    sleep 1
    echo -ne "Something that changed\r"
    sleep 1
    echo -ne "the subject goes here\r"
    sleep 1
    echo -ne "\r"
} | socat - EXEC:'fast-conventional commit.txt',pty,setsid,ctty
```

Now if we look at the commit

``` shell,script(name="cat-file")
cat commit.txt
```

``` text,verify(name="cat-file")
fix(github)!: the subject goes here


BREAKING CHANGE: Something that changed
```
