Make conventional commits, faster, and consistently name scopes

## Usage

Given we have configured the tool, it looks for this in the root of the
git repository.

> `.fastconventional.yaml`

``` yaml,file(path=".fastconventional.yaml")
use_angular: true
types: [ci]
scopes: ["mergify", "just", "github"]
```

When we commit, git has generated this stub configuration

``` text,file(path="commit.txt")
# Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting
# with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.
#
# On branch master
# Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.
#
# Changes to be committed:
#       new file:   README.md
```

We can add our conventional message using this neat UI
