## Installing

See the [releases
page](https://github.com/PurpleBooth/fast-conventional/releases/latest)
we build for linux and mac (all x86_64), alternatively use brew

``` shell,skip()
brew install PurpleBooth/repo/fast-conventional
```

## Usage

> `.fastconventional.yaml`

``` yaml,file(path=".fastconventional.yaml")
use_angular: true
types: [ci]
scopes: ["mergify", "just", "github"]
```

``` text,file(path="commit.txt")
# Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting
# with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.
#
# On branch master
# Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.
#
# Changes to be committed:
#       new file:   README.md
```

We have a nice interactive UI that you can't really see here, but this
simulates the steps

``` shell,script(name="full")
{
    sleep 1
    echo -ne "fix\r"
    sleep 1
    echo -ne "github\r"
    sleep 1
    echo -ne "Something that changed\r"
    sleep 1
    echo -ne "the subject goes here\r"
    sleep 1
    echo -ne "\r"
} | socat - EXEC:'fast-conventional commit.txt',pty,setsid,ctty
```

Now if we look at the commit

``` shell,script(name="cat-file")
cat commit.txt
```

``` text,verify(name="cat-file")
fix(github)!: the subject goes here


BREAKING CHANGE: Something that changed
```

This binary is designed to be run as a `prepare-commit-msg` hook. To
install it into a repository run

``` shell,script(name="installing")
git init .
ln -s "$(fast-conventional)" .git/hooks/prepare-commit-msg
```

And it'll trigger when generating the commit
